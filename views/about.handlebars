<h1>About</h1>
<p>Let’s do a quick Turing Test. Below, you’ll see ten machine learning project ideas. Five of them are generated by a
    human and five of them are generated by a neural network. Your task is to tell them apart.

    Ready? (Don’t overthink. Just go with your gut).

    Stock trading learner
    Predicting what is the difference in frequency in data
    Machine learning for patent classification
    Classifying the convolutional characteristics of remote — sensing images
    Face detection with random forests
    Machine learning to predict career success
    Rotation-invariant sparse coding
    The application of deep learning to fairness
    Object recognition from 3D point clouds
    Model of architecture in California
    Seen the list? Take note of the five ideas that you think a neural network generated, and the five that a human
    generated.</p>
